Hi, I'm Bridget! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP). My research interests include Galactic archeology, chemical tagging, and chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk. Please see my [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&q=pubdate%3A%5B2020-01%20TO%209999-12%5D%20author%3A(%22Ratcliffe%2C%20Bridget%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7PnnbB8AAAAJ) profile for my publication list.
